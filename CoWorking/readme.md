In this page my main intent was to test responsiveness but i also added a popup when you try to click 'Book' button( Scrimba Project )
* I learnt to implement fixed position with message box on the bottom right corner and popup that is always in the middle of page
* Learnt to ask for a specific type in input and making it mandatory to answer when they try to click submit button
